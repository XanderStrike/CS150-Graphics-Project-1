# Project 1: Hello World 2D

1. Create a repository.

2. Change the window title so it says CS 150 instead of CS 175.

3. Try resizing the window. Notice that the aspect ration of the square/rectangle changes when the aspect ratio of the window changes.  Fix this.  That is, make it so that the square/rectangle resizes appropriately and maintains its aspect ratio when the window is resized.  Make sure the square (it its original aspect ratio) never gets cropped. Do this without changing the coordinates of the vertices that are sent to the vertex shader, and without modifying the call to glViewport. You may modify the vertex shader, and you may modify the uniform variables that are sent to it.

4. Change the smiley face to a picture of yourself. You can also change the squirrel to something else if you want.

5. Out of the box, the color gradient changes continuously (i.e., at every pixel).  Make it so that the color gradient changes less frequently, to achieve a checkered effect.  (See below.)
